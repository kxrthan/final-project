      1. **Functionality and Logic**: Maintain all the functionality and logic of the original code without alteration.
      2. **Optimization**: Optimize the code for:
         - Readability: Use descriptive variable and function names.
         - Performance: Implement efficient algorithms and data structures.
         - Maintainability: Use modular design and proper code organization.
      3. **Modern Conventions**: Incorporate modern programming practices:
         - Object-oriented design (where applicable).
         - Use of appropriate language constructs, such as async/await in JavaScript, or list comprehensions in Python.
      4. **Input/Output Handling**: Implement file handling and input/output operations in a way that aligns with ${targetLanguage} standards.
      5. **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling mechanisms to account for edge cases.
      6. **Avoid Complexity**: Refrain from adding unnecessary complexity. Use native libraries or features unless external libraries are essential for the task.
      7. **Code Output**: Return the converted code in a format suitable for ${targetLanguage}, with clear and consistent formatting.
      8. **No Comments or Explanations**: The output should be the converted code only, with no additional text or comments.
